Configuration:

The configuration requires that both the galaxy and refine plugins know which 
server the other is running on (and what the name is to an external visitor)
The host names for the servers are currently hardcoded in the source.

To configure the refine plugin, edit the file: galaxy/module/index.vt

Change the line:
    <form id="tool_form" name="tool_form" action="http://localhost:8080/tool_runner/index" ...

To point to your Galaxy server (as seen by an external visitor)

To configure the Galaxy tool, edit the file galaxy_refine/refine_edit.xml

Change the line:
      <param name="REDIRECT_URL" type="hidden" value="http://localhost:3333/extension/galaxy/"/>

To point to your Refine server.
